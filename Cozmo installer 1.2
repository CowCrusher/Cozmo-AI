So first thanks for choseing cozmo AI the terminal conpanion
1. sudo pacman -Syu python
2. sudo pacman -S nano
3. nano cozmo.py
3. paste cozmo into file
4. ctrl x
5. y enter  
6. now cozmo is installed
7. To start him "Python cosmo.py"enter

To use chat gpt you need your own API
1. get API
2. nano cosmo.py
3. find API holder
4. enter API
5. ctrl x
6. y enter
7. then make sure he gets to the chatgpt server if not try again if still not working open a new issue.

Have Fun [] []
